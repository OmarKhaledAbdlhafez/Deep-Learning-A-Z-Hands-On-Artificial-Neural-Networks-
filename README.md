#  **EXCITING PROJECTS**
Inside this class we will work on Real-World datasets, to solve Real-World business problems. (Definitely not the boring iris or digit classification datasets that we see in every course). In this course we will solve six real-world challenges:
 - Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem
 -   Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition
 -   Recurrent Neural Networks to predict Stock Prices
 -   Self-Organizing Maps to investigate Fraud
 -   Boltzmann Machines to create a Recomender System
 -   Stacked Autoencoders* to take on the challenge for the **Netflix $1 
Million prize**
# Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem
**Churn Modelling Problem**
**ann project folder **

In this part you will be solving a data analytics challenge for a bank. You will be given a dataset with a large sample of the bank's customers. To make this dataset, the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank.

Your goal is to make an Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn). Besides, you are asked to rank all the customers of the bank, based on their probability of leaving. To do that, you will need to use the right Deep Learning model, one that is based on a probabilistic approach.

If you succeed in this project, you will create significant added value to the bank. By applying your Deep Learning model the bank may significantly reduce customer churn.

## Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition
**2 Image Recognition**

In this part, you will create a Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images. We will implement this Deep Learning model to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures. However, this model can be reused to detect anything else and we will show you how to do it - by simply changing the pictures in the input folder.

For example, you will be able to train the same model on a set of brain images, to detect if they contain a tumor or not. But if you want to keep it fitted to cats and dogs, then you will literally be able to a take a picture of your cat or your dog, and your model will predict which pet you have. We even tested it out on Hadelinâ€™s dog!
